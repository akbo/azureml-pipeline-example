= Azure ML Pipeline Example

This repository contains example code for using Azure Machine Learning Pipelines:

* How to define them
* How to publish and update them
* How to trigger them via their REST endpoints
* How to schedule them

== How to use the example code

. Change `.azureml/config.json` so it points to your Azure ML workspace.
. Create and activate the conda environment on your machine: From within the repo directory, first run
+
[source, sh]
....
$ conda env create
....
then run
+
[source, sh]
....
$ conda activate azure_ml_pipeline_example
....
. Have a Service Principal (= technical user) created and put its details in `config.py`. For more info on authentication in Azure ML, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-setup-authentication[this site].
. Now that the environment is set up, you can run
+
[source, sh]
....
$ python azure_ml_pipeline_example.py
....
